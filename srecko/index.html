          <h3> a bit about Srećko </h3>
          <p>
            Srećko has been my pet for many years, but he is more than that. He is also one of my
            closest friends and even an anchor during dark times. His name is pronounced as
            Sreh-chko, as it is a Serbian name. It roughly translates to happy, or he who is happy.
            Throughout the rest of the page I will refer to him as simply Srecko for ease of reading
            however. He was given this name as it sounded cute but also describes him very well. As
            he is always full of energy and ready for an adventure. As he is still in Europe, I dont
            get to see him as often as I did. But my memories of him will always be treasured, and I
            still look forward to seeing him every time I visit my grandma in Serbia.

          <h3> His early days </h3>
          <p>
            Back in the dark ages, or also known as 2013, my sisters and our grandma were strolling
            through the town of Obrenovac in Serbia. Where they saw a man walking his pekingese dog.
            My sisters were immediatly stunned and wanted to pet the adorable dog. When our grandma
            inquired about the dog she found out that the man was in fact a certified pekingese
            breeder, and that soon he will have a new batch of pups if they were interested. My
            grandma originally thought my sisters would forget about the pups, but they did nothing
            but ask her about them nearly daily. Eventually the fated day came, and Srecko was
            blessed onto our family. From his early days he was always pampered and treated with
            nothing but love. He would sleep in our beds, be given small scraps and treats, and
            always held as a baby.

          <h3> Through the years </h3>
          <p>
            As Srecko grew older he became an increasingly important man of our family. Whenever any
            of us would be going through a tough time, or experiencing any kind of difficulty in our
            lives, Srecko would be there for us. He was always keen on noticing these differences in
            emotion and would always do his best to cheer us up, or just lay with us to help us
            relax. He has always been treated well by us all, and in turn he always was the best we
            could ask for. As he grew up with us he was also someone that me, my sisters, and my
            grandma could all bond over. As beforehand we didn't have any real things connecting us
            all other than kinship. But Srecko was slowly becoming a huge part of our lives. I
            remember everytime I would come home from school as I ascended the stairs to our
            apartment he would start barking. As I slowly got closer to our door he would start
            scratching at the door and wanting to say hi. When I finally entered he would jump all
            over me, rejoiced that I finally came home for what im sure felt like an eternity for
            him. But was in reality just another slow day of high-school.

          <h4> Other events I can recall </h4>
          <p>
            There have been so many stories that I can recall with my boy, but I think two of my
            favorites are one during a big flood and one while I was walking him. Back in 2014
            Serbia was hit by massive floods. Our small town was absolutely submerged with water. As
            an example, we lived in a 4 story building. When the flood hit the ground floor was
            fully submerged in water and the water nearly reached the first floor. I remember being
            woked up by my grandma that we were completely blocked in and that there was a huge
            flood in the country. When I walked out of our apartment to see for myself me and Srecko
            both descened down the steps until we reached the water. That memory of just the two of
            us at the top of the stairs witnessing so much water will always be something special
            for me to look back on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second story I remember fondly was one day while I was walking him. Me and Srecko
            were having a good time walking in the yard in front of our building, just walkin around
            as you do. When all of a sudden he sees a dog. One part about Srecko which I have not
            mentioned up to this point is that while he was and always has been a bundle of joy and
            love in our family... he isn't the biggest fan of other dogs. He is very territorial in
            that regard. So upon seeing another dog he immediatly goes haywire, and starts barking
            and trying to chase them. As im holding him back at some point the little latch that
            connected the leash to his collar unlatched. And he was let free. I was petrified
            because I was worried how far he was going to chase after this dog. Another fact to
            remember is that I have never been a particularly active person. But when I saw my dog
            running I bolted right after him with all the speed I could muster. At one point he
            turns a corner chasing after his victim, which in turn makes him go out of my vision. As
            I run to that corner I see Srecko just vibing in a patch of dandelions. The other dog
            nowhere to be seen. I have no idea to this day which way the dog went or why Srecko
            stopped chasing them but the experience as a whole is definitely one I will never
            forget.

          <h3> The present </h3>
          <p>
            In the present day, I dont currently live with Srecko. He is currently still with my
            Sister and Grandma in Serbia. Do not worry however, as I still am sent many photos
            throughout the week by both my gran and my sister. He is still the same bundle of joy
            and energy he has always been, although now with less of us in the house I am sure that
            its not quite the same. Now however, as we are all struggling through a pandemic and
            what not. My grandma has finally had an excuse to just rest and relax, rather than
            always work around the house. As she was always one who disliked staying still. Now, her
            and Srecko relax lounging in the Sun or staying indoors in our cabin. Simply enjoying
            themselves and Srecko always manages to keep my grandma active. Due to him always
            running around or causing a ruckus. As he always will, and always has. A true
            troublemaker at heart.
